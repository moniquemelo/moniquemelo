# Hello! üëã

My name is Monique Melo, I live in S√£o Paulo, Brazil and I'm a student of Computer Engineering. 
I'm currently studying the Python language and starting to study HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm starting to develop small Python applications in order to create a flow with SQLite. Soon, I intend to develop new applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript and to go deeper and deeper into the incredible universe of programming.

I'm at the beginning of a long journey, but extremely happy and excited to do it. üòç

####Learning journey:
- Python 
- SQLite (DB Browser / SQL Server)
- HTML, CSS and Javascript
